-- B-074: prevent replay submissions with the same blockchain tx hash for burn transactions.
-- Deduplicate pre-existing rows before enforcing the constraint.
-- For each (type, blockchain_tx_hash) pair with duplicates, keep the oldest
-- (by created_at) and delete newer rows. Rows with NULL type or hash are never
-- duplicates and are preserved.
-- NOTE: transactions.id is a UUID, so MIN(id)/MAX(id) do not exist in Postgres;
-- ordering by created_at (then id as tiebreaker) instead.
